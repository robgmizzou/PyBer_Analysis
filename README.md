PyBer Summary Data based on City Type:<br>

Key findings:<br>
  1) Large proportion of rides come in Urban city types; these are also the lowest average fare.<br>
  2) Urban cities have more drivers than riders, indicating that driver supply may be too high relative to rider demand.<br>
  3) Rural riders generate the highest fares, potentially indicating longer fares.<br>

## Business Recmmendations:<br>
  1) Incentivize new rural drivers or existing drivers taking more trips to meet excess demand<br>
  2) PyBer could work to generate more demand in support of of the excess driver capacity in Urban cities.<br>
  3) Oversupply of urban drivers indicates inefficiency - excess drivers should consider Suburban routes to increase productivity.  PyBer could work to generate more      demand in support of of the excess capacity.<br>
